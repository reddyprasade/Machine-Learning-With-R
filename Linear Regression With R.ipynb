    "From the scatter plot above, it can be seen that not all the data points fall exactly on the fitted regression line. Some of the points are above the blue curve and some are below it; overall, the residual errors (e) have approximately mean zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the squares of the residual errors are called the **Residual Sum of Squares or [RSS].**\n",
    "\n",
    "The average variation of points around the fitted regression line is called the **Residual Standard Error (RSE)**. This is one the metrics used to evaluate the overall quality of the fitted regression model. The lower the RSE, the better it is.\n",

    "The difference between an observed (actual) value of the dependent variable and the value of the dependent variable predicted from the regression line.\n",

    "### Algorithm\n",
    "Linear regression is based on least square estimation which says regression coefficients (estimates) should be chosen in such a way that it minimizes the sum of the squared distances of each observed response to its fitted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Minimum Sample Size***\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression requires 5 cases per independent variable in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions of Linear Regression Analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear Relationship : Linear regression needs a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Normality of Residual : Linear regression requires residuals should be normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity :  Linear regression assumes that residuals are approximately equal for all predicted dependent variable values. In other words, it means constant variance of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. No Outlier Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Multicollinearity : It means there is a high correlation between independent variables. The linear regression model MUST NOT be faced with problem of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Independence of error terms - No Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "It states that the errors associated with one observation are not correlated with the errors of any other observation. It is a problem when you use time series data. Suppose you have collected data from labors in eight different districts. It is likely that the labors within each district will tend to be more like one another that labors from different districts, that is, their errors are not independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distribution of Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression assumes target or dependent variable to be normally distributed. Normal Distribution is same as Gaussian distribution. It uses identity link function of gaussian family\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standardized Coefficients**\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of standardization or standardized coefficients (aka estimates) comes into picture when predictors (aka independent variables) are expressed in different units. Suppose you have 3 independent variables - age, height and weight. The variable 'age' is expressed in years, height in cm, weight in kg. If we need to rank these predictors based on the unstandardized coefficient, it would not be a fair comparison as the unit of these variable is not same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardized Coefficients (or Estimates) are mainly used to rank predictors (or independent or explanatory variables) as it eliminate the units of measurement of  independent and dependent variables). We can rank independent variables with absolute value of standardized coefficients. The most important variable will have maximum absolute value of standardized coefficient.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Interpretation of Standardized Coefficient**\n",
    "\n",
    "A standardized coefficient value of 1.25 indicates that a change of one standard deviation in the independent variable results in a 1.25 standard deviations increase in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measures of Model Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **R-squared**\n",
    "\n",
    "It measures the proportion of the variation in your dependent variable explained by all of your independent variables in the model. It assumes that every independent variable in the model helps to explain variation in the dependent variable. In reality, some variables don't affect dependent variable and they don't help building a good model.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In the numerator of equation above, yi-hat is the predicted value. Mean value of Y appears in denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Rule :***\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data. In psychological surveys or studies, we generally found low R-squared values lower than 0.5. It is because we are trying to predict human behavior and it is not easy to predict humans. In these cases, if your R-squared value is low but you have statistically significant independent variables (aka predictors), you can still generate insights about how changes in the predictor values are associated with changes in the response value.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Can R-Squared be negative?***\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it is when horizontal line explains the data better than your model. It mostly happens when you do not include intercept. Without an intercept, the regression could do worse than the sample mean in terms of predicting the target variable. It is not only because of exclusion of intercept. It can be negative even with inclusion of intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Mathematically***, it is possible when error sum-of-squares from the model is larger than the total sum-of-squares from the horizontal line.\n",
    "                \n",
    "                R-squared = 1 - [(Sum of Square Error)/(Total Sum of Square)]\n",
    "                \n",
    "2. **Adjusted R-squared**\n",
    "\n",
    "It measures the proportion of variation explained by only those independent variables that really affect the dependent variable. It penalizes you for adding independent variable that do not affect the dependent variable.\n",
    "![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0ohbV-H-3aY/XPtiQnx50mI/AAAAAAAAdXU/MXraj5c18eAd1dlQfmQunNV_BcsP0lBdgCK8BGAs/s0/2019-06-08.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-Squared is more important metrics than R-squared\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you add a independent variable to a model, the R-squared increases, even if the independent variable is insignificant. It never declines. Whereas Adjusted R-squared increases only when independent variable is significant and affects dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **RMSE ( Root Mean Square Error)**\n",
    "\n",
    "It explains how close the actual data points are to the model’s predicted values. It measures standard deviation of the residuals.\n",

    "In the formula above, yi is the actual values of dependent variable and yi-hat is the predicted values, n - sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Important Point\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE has the same unit as dependent variable. For example, dependent variable is sales which is measured in dollars. Let's say RMSE of this sales model comes out 21. We can say it is 21 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is good RMSE score?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no thumb rule regarding good or bad RMSE score. It is because it is dependent on your dependent variable. If your target variable lies between 0 to 100. RMSE of 0.5 can be considered as good but same 0.5 RMSE can be considered as a poor score if dependent variable ranges from 0 to 10. Hence there is so such good or bad RMSE by simply looking at the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower values of RMSE indicate better fit. RMSE is a good measure of how accurately the model predicts the response, and is the most important criterion for fit if the main purpose of the model is prediction.\n",
    "The RMSE for your training and your test sets should be very similar if you have built a good model. If the RMSE for the test set is much higher than that of the training set, it is likely that you've badly over fit the data, i.e. you've created a model that works well in sample, but has little predictive value when tested out of sample\n",
    "\n",
    "***RMSE vs MAE***\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE amplifies and severely punishes large errors as compared to mean absolute error (MAE).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**R-Squared vs RMSE**\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is in proportion and has no units associated to target variable whereas RMSE has units associated to target variable. Hence, R-squared is a relative measure of fit, RMSE is an absolute measure of fit.\n",

    "Correlation is a statistical measure that suggests the level of linear dependence between two variables, that occur in pair – just like what we have here in speed and dist. Correlation can take values between -1 to +1. If we observe for every instance where speed increases, the distance also increases along with it, then there is a high positive correlation between them and therefore the correlation between them will be closer to 1. The opposite is true for an inverse relationship, in which case, the correlation between the variables will be close to -1.\n",

    "A value closer to 0 suggests a weak relationship between the variables. A low correlation (-0.2 < x < 0.2) probably suggests that much of variation of the response variable (Y) is unexplained by the predictor (X), in which case, we should probably look for better explanatory variables."

    "The summary statistics above tells us a number of things. One of them is the model p-Value (bottom last line) and the p-Value of individual predictor variables (extreme right column under ‘Coefficients’). The p-Values are very important because, We can consider a linear model to be statistically significant only when both these p-Values are less that the pre-determined statistical significance level, which is ideally 0.05. This is visually interpreted by the significance stars at the end of the row. The more the stars beside the variable’s p-Value, the more significant the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null and alternate hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is a p-value, there is a hull and alternative hypothesis associated with it. In Linear Regression, the Null Hypothesis is that the coefficients associated with the variables is equal to zero. The alternate hypothesis is that the coefficients are not equal to zero (i.e. there exists a relationship between the independent variable in question and the dependent variable).\n",

    "**t-value**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can interpret the t-value something like this. A larger t-value indicates that it is less likely that the coefficient is not equal to zero purely by chance. So, higher the t-value, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pr(>|t|) or p-value is the probability that you get a t-value as high or higher than the observed value when the Null Hypothesis (the β coefficient is equal to zero or that there is no relationship) is true. So if the Pr(>|t|) is low, the coefficients are significant (significantly different from zero). If the Pr(>|t|) is high, the coefficients are not significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means to us? when p Value is less than significance level (< 0.05), we can safely reject the null hypothesis that the co-efficient β of the predictor is zero. In our case, linearMod, both these p-Values are well below the 0.05 threshold, so we can conclude our model is indeed statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",

As you add more X variables to your model, the R-Squared value of the new bigger model will always be greater than that of the smaller subset. This is because, since all the variables in the original model is also present, their contribution to explain the dependent variable will be present in the super-set as well, therefore, whatever new variable we add can only add (if not significantly) to the variation that was already explained. It is here, the adjusted R-Squared value comes to help. Adj R-Squared penalizes total value for the number of terms (read predictors) in your model.
